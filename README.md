## Description

- This project was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js. I was motivated to build this project to show my skillsets, about info, contact info, and resume at a glance. It was built because I wanted to create a professional-level portfolio that is user-friendly and provides potential employers with the information they would need to know about me. It is intended to solve the problem of having to sift through information about me by centralizing the relevant information in one place. In making said project, I learned about resume-building as well as refined my skills with next.js and full-stack web development.
